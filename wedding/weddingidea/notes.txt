This is a place to put learning experiences down.

Templating: if you want an over-arching template for apps to use, add a folder named 'template' to the project directory (aka add it next to manage.py).
You can refernce this: {% extends 'main.html' %} where main.html is the html file you want to use
If you want to use a templating extension within an app, you can create a file to be extended (appmain.html in this case). If you want to refernce it other templates
then you must reference it as: {% extends 'appname/appmain.html' %} where appname is the name of the app you created.

In order to extend a Profile of a user, I was first using a OneToOne model field type when really it should have been a ForeignKey type. I kept receiving an
error: UNIQUE constraint failed: accounts_profile.user_id. This was because the account was still being made behind the scenes, however it wasnt able
to uniquely relate a profile to that user. So I had to add 'profile = get_object_or_404(Profile, user=request.user)' to the first line of my view so I could
uniquely ID the user and therefore the profile.
